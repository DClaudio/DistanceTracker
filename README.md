# DistanceTracker - initial scalatra template

The ideea is to have REST API for a mobile app that will tell you how far you are from another device. 
As the first milestone, both devices will communicate with the API by sending their GPS data and receving GPS data from the other device. The distance will be computed in the mobile app by calculating the difference between the GPS coordinates.
